Use Rpi CM4 and AC180 on a single board for OpenHD.

It seems that I cannot buy an ochin board for OpenHD, so I create this simple carrier board for CM4 and AC180.

Maybe a little big, but it just works. I can make it smaller, by put the AC180 under the CM4, but in that case, it is harder to solder. I'm trying to make it easier for everyone with a simple hot plate to complete this design.

The BEC module may need another electrolytic capacitor for less ripple.

The CM4 is easy to get, and AC180 can be bought from Aliexpress.
